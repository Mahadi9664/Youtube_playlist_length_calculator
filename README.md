# Youtube_playlist_length_calculator
I was trying to plan for my studies. Then i found I had to finish a couple of playlists. They were long including many videos so I wanted to find out exactly how long it will take me to complete all the videos. Didn't want to calculate manually so, wrote this code.  putting on Github so that you can use it too.
